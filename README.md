**Problem Statement:**
Online shopping is an attractive alternative to traditional shopping, which continues to have an upward trend in popularity, which was expedited by the coronavirus pandemic. However, online shopping often falls short of its in-person counterpart due to factors such as lack of available information, lack of immersion, and inefficient design and functionality. As more business becomes conducted online, itâ€™s imperative for businesses to make improvements to their online shopping experience to capture market share.
